* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

## Reflection

### PID Controller

The P component of the controller leads to corrections of the steering angle proportional to the offset. Since this leads to a vanishing steering angle when the car crosses the desired trajectory at an angle, the car is bound to overshoot, leading to a car, which osciallates around the target trajectory. Adding the D component dampens the osciallations by counteracting the P component proportionally to the rate of change of the offset.

If the system has a constant bias, e.g. if the actual steering angle of the car is always 2 degrees more than the value sent to the steering control unit, the PD controller alone cannot converge to a vanishing offset error. This can be resolved by adding the I component, which aggregates all offsets over time, thus driving the system more and more to osciallate around an offset of 0.

### Tuning the Parameters

I started off by using just a P controller. As expected this lead to the car osciallating around the target trajectory with increasing amplitude, soon driving the car off the track. Next, I increased K_d until the osciallations were reduced to a reasonable level. I then noticed that this PD controller with rather large K_p and K_d (both O(10)) lead to a rather low offset, but the drive looked quite uncomfortable, with many short bursts of large steering angle changes. To make the ride smoother, I reduced K_p and K_d together until K_p was almost no longer large enough to take the sharp turns of the track. This lead me to the final values: K_p = 0.1 and K_d = 1.6.

With this setup I noticed that the offset all throughout the track was positive, suggesting a bias. I then searched for a K_i in orders of magnitude upwards from 1E-6 and found K_i = 0.0001 to get rid of the offset sufficiently quickly.

It would have been nice to implement an automatic control parameter optimization (e.g. coordinate ascent), but I saw no easy way to run many consecutive tests in the simulator in an automated fashion.
